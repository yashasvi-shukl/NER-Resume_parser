# NER-Resume_parser
Named Entity Recognition to extract custom entities from Resumes 
#HrAnalytics 

# As the dataset was small (i.e., only 200 resumes) the model accuracy is not so good.
# I have tested with different sample resumes and found that for some resumes model is able to find the entities whereas it fails to recongnize entity few resumes.
# Please use simple resume format for better results.
